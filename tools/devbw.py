devbw.py - measure a device the way the ENGINE actually reads it.

WHY NOT dd
    dd is one sequential stream at queue depth 1. The expert path is random 17.55 MB
    O_DIRECT reads issued up to 16 at a time by the MoE block's batch prefetch. Those are
    different workloads, and on network-backed storage they differ by a large factor, so
    a dd number cannot tell you whether a device is the bottleneck for THIS engine.

WHAT IT REPORTS
    Achieved MB/s for expert-sized random O_DIRECT reads at queue depth 1 and at queue
    depth 16, the depths the engine uses without and with the batch prefetch. The gap
    between the two is the headroom the prefetch can convert into speed on this device;
    if they are equal, the device does not reward depth and the prefetch buys nothing.
