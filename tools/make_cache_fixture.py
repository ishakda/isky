make_cache_fixture.py - a small safetensors shard holding COMPLETE routed experts, so the
streaming expert cache can be tested without the 1.56 TB checkpoint.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The streaming cache is the part of this project everything else rests on, and no
    other test reaches it. Every op fixture and all three oracle gates exercise the
    RESIDENT expert bank (K3MoeW.w1/w3/w2); the cache path (K3MoeW.src) is only taken
    when running the real model against real shards.

    That gap is not theoretical. A batch-prefetch defect handing the same slot to several
    experts at once satisfies every op fixture and all three oracle gates, because none
    of them ever calls the cache, the only symptom is a different token from the real
    model, which is indistinguishable from any other difference without a reference to
    compare against. These fixtures make the cache testable on its own.

    The fixtures here are tiny -- six U8 tensors per expert, a few KB each -- but they are
    STRUCTURALLY real: the same six-tensor naming, the same U8 dtypes, laid out
    back-to-back so k3_expert_ref sees one contiguous run exactly as it does in the real
    checkpoint.

WHAT MAKES THE CONTENT USEFUL
    Every byte of expert e is derived from e, so if the cache ever returns expert a's
    bytes for expert b -- which is precisely what slot aliasing does -- the test sees it
    immediately rather than seeing plausible-looking noise.
