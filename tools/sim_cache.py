sim_cache.py - how much RAM does Kimi K3 actually need?

THE IDEA
    Hit rate versus cache size is the question the whole streaming design turns on, and
    measuring it directly would mean re-running the model once per cache size on a
    machine big enough to hold the whole expert pool. That is expensive and unnecessary:
    routing does not depend on the cache, so ONE run produces the entire curve. k3_cache
    records every (layer, expert) request in order, and this replays that trace at any
    capacity under any policy.

WHAT IT REPORTS
    LRU      what the engine actually implements.
    Belady   the optimal offline policy, which no real cache can beat. The gap between
             the two is the most a cleverer replacement policy could ever be worth. If
             the gap is small, effort belongs in prefetching or pinning, not in
             replacement.
    Pinned   the hottest N experts held permanently, LRU for the rest. This is what the
             usage histogram is for.
