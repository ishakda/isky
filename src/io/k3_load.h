/* k3_load.h - resolve Kimi K3 checkpoint tensors and stream routed experts.
 *
 * THE MEASUREMENT THIS FILE IS BUILT ON
 *   Reading all 96 shard headers showed that the six tensors making up one routed
 *   expert (w1, w2, w3, each with weight_packed and weight_scale) are laid out as ONE
 *   contiguous run of exactly 17,547,264 bytes, in the order
 *       w1.packed w1.scale w2.packed w2.scale w3.packed w3.scale
 *   with no gaps. This holds for all 896 experts in the shard checked, and the loader
 *   verifies it per expert rather than assuming it.
 *
 *   That is what makes streaming cheap: fetching an
 *   expert is a single coalesced pread, not six scattered ones. On a spinning-rust or
 *   network-backed store the difference is six seeks per expert per layer per token,
 *   which at top-16 over 92 layers is 8,832 seeks a token instead of 1,472.
 *
 *   17,547,264 bytes is 0.53125 bytes per parameter over 33,030,144 parameters: half a
 *   byte for the nibble plus one byte per 32-element group for the E8M0 scale.
 *
 * THE FALLBACK IS NOT DEAD CODE
 *   If a future checkpoint revision interleaves tensors differently, k3_expert_ref
 *   reports contiguous = 0 and k3_expert_load issues six preads into the same buffer
 *   layout. The result is identical; only the seek count changes.
